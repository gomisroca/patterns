## Command Pattern

We can _decouple_ objs that execute a task from the obj that calls the method.

### Example

```js
class OrderManager() {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = []
  }

  placeOrder(order, id) {
    this.orders.push(id)
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  }

  trackOrder(id) {
    return `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`
  }

  cancelOrder(id) {
    this.orders = this.orders.filter(order => order.id !== id)
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `OrderManager` class that has various methods. We could use these methods directly, but that could lead to issues down the line (renaming, refactoring, etc.).

Instead, we can refactor the class to have a single `execute` method that will execute any command its given:

```js
class OrderManager {
  constructor() {
    this.orders = [];
  }

  execute(command, ...args) {
    return command.execute(this.orders, ...args);
  }
}
```

Now, we simply need to create a `Command` class that will contain the logic for each command:

```js
class Command {
  constructor(execute) {
    this.execute = execute;
  }
}

function PlaceOrderCommand(order, id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders.push(id);
    return `You have successfully ordered ${order} (${id})`;
  });
}

function CancelOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command((orders) => {
    orders = orders.filter((order) => order.id !== id);
    return `You have canceled your order ${id}`;
  });
}

function TrackOrderCommand(id) {
  return new Command(() => `Your order ${id} will arrive in 20 minutes.`);
}
```

Now we can use the methods without worrying about the internals:

```js
const manager = new OrderManager();

manager.execute(new PlaceOrderCommand("Pad Thai", "1234"));
manager.execute(new TrackOrderCommand("1234"));
manager.execute(new CancelOrderCommand("1234"));
```

### Pros

- More control over commands

### Cons

- Lots of boilerplate
- Limited use cases
